# Capricious
## Filtering Twitch Chat Viewer written in Java

Following the Twitch chat of a channel during a popular event can be really hard.

2. Run Capricious with `java -jar build/libs/capricious.jar` or `./gradlew run`.
3. You will be asked for the name of a Twitch channel, e.g. "GamesDoneQuick".
4. Press OK.
5. You're now viewing the Twitch Chat for that channel, without the duplicate messages.
